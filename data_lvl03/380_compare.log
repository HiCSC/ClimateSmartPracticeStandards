<   to Manage Snow Deposition:
<   - Orient the windbreak as close to perpendicular to the predominant snow-bearing wind as practical.
<     Locate windbreaks so that snow deposition will not pose a health or safety problem, management constraint, or obstruct human, animal, or vehicular traffic.
<     Windbreak density during expected snow-producing months must be at least 50 percent.
<   - Where it is desirable for wind to blow snow off road surfaces and limit ice formation, design windbreaks using greater setback distances and allow for maximum mature windbreak height as well as 20-year height.
<   - Where soil erosion and/or runoff from melting snow can be a hazard, control it by adjusting the siting of new windbreaks prior to establishment or by using appropriate supporting practices.
<   for Managing Snow Distribution:
<   - For managing snow distribution across a field, windbreak density during expected snow-producing months should be 25 to 50 percent.
<     The interval between windbreaks should not exceed 20H.

<   - Use windbreaks as needed to provide shade and reduce wind or snow impacts to animals, structures, and humans, or to reduce energy use.

<     When woody residue or other debris requires onsite burning, use NRCS CPS Prescribed Burning (Code 338).

<   - Use deciduous trees on south and west sides of structures to reduce summer energy use.
<     Use conifer windbreaks to reduce impacts of prevailing winter winds and reduce energy use.

<   Managing Snow:
<   - Consider additional actions for situations where a windbreak alone does not provide enough snow storage.
<     Add windbreak rows or obtain supplementary storage with temporary or herbaceous wind barriers, constructed or living snow fences, or by retaining standing crop residues within the fetch (storage) area.
<     Retain standing crop residues to enhance the effectiveness of windbreaks in uniformly distributing snow across a field.
<   - To control end drifts, extend the length of the windbreak beyond the protected area, add supplemental windbreak legs, use greater setback distances, and/or use temporary or herbaceous wind barriers.
<   - Secondary windbreaks made up of shorter tree species can be used to address snow control when winds come from directions different than the prevailing wind.
