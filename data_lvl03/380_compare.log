<   to Manage Snow Deposition:
<   - Orient the windbreak as close to perpendicular to the predominant snow-bearing
<     wind as practical. Locate windbreaks so that snow deposition will not pose a health or safety problem, management
<     constraint, or obstruct human, animal, or vehicular traffic. Windbreak density
<     during expected snow-producing months must be at least 50 percent.
<   - Where it is desirable for wind to blow snow off road surfaces and limit ice formation,
<     design windbreaks using greater setback distances and allow for maximum mature
<     windbreak height as well as 20-year height.
<   - Where soil erosion and/or runoff from melting snow can be a hazard, control it
<     by adjusting the siting of new windbreaks prior to establishment or by using appropriate
<     supporting practices.
<   for Managing Snow Distribution:
<   - For managing snow distribution across a field, windbreak density during expected
<     snow-producing months should be 25 to 50 percent. The interval between windbreaks should not exceed
<     20H.

<   Managing Snow:
<   - Consider additional actions for situations where a windbreak alone does not provide
<     enough snow storage. Add windbreak rows or obtain supplementary storage with temporary or
<     herbaceous wind barriers, constructed or living snow fences, or by retaining standing
<     crop residues within the fetch (storage) area. Retain standing crop residues to
<     enhance the effectiveness of windbreaks in uniformly distributing snow across
<     a field.
<   - To control end drifts, extend the length of the windbreak beyond the protected
<     area, add supplemental windbreak legs, use greater setback distances, and/or use
<     temporary or herbaceous wind barriers.
<   - Secondary windbreaks made up of shorter tree species can be used to address snow
<     control when winds come from directions different than the prevailing wind.
