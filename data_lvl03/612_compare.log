<   - Select one or more species that are suited to site conditions, appropriate for
<     the planned purpose(s).
<   - Utilize ecological site descriptions, natural plant communities, conservation
<     tree and shrub guides, or comparable reference sites to guide species selection.
<   - Determine desired stocking levels for trees and/or shrubs based on landowner objectives
<     and ecological characteristics of the site and species. Plant, seed, or naturally
<     regenerate at densities and rates that reflect anticipated seedling mortality
<     to achieve desired stocking levels in the established stand.
<   - Use NRCS Conservation Practice Standard (CPS) Tree-Shrub Site Preparation (Code
<     490) to prepare sites for planting, seeding, or natural regeneration if conditions
<     are not suitable for establishing the desired plants. Use NRCS CPSs Brush Management
<     (Code 314), Herbaceous Weed Treatment (Code 315), or Prescribed Burning (Code
<     338) after planting, as needed, to create desirable conditions for establishing
<     the desired plants.
<   - When utilizing natural regeneration to establish trees and/or shrubs, an adequate
<     source of seed, vegetative propagules, or advanced regeneration must be present
<     or planned at a level sufficient to achieve objectives. Where natural regeneration relies on seed sources, apply any
<     needed stand treatments and site preparation at appropriate times to facilitate
<     germination and establishment of seeds from desired species. Modify forest stand
<     conditions prior to initiating natural regeneration to obtain the desired species
<     composition, density, and arrangement of trees and shrubs as needed, using supporting
<     conservation practices.
<   - Implement coppice regeneration (originating from root shoots or stump sprouts)
<     based on suitability of tree species, age, diameter, and site conditions. Determine
<     the correct timing for coppice regeneration based on species characteristics.
<   - Select only viable, high-quality, and adapted plant materials. Do not establish
<     species on the Federal or State invasive species or noxious weed lists. Select
<     planting stock that conforms to established seed transfer protocols within the
<     State and complies with minimum standards accepted by the American National Standards
<     Institute (ANSI). Choose planting dates, techniques, and handling methods appropriate
<     for the site conditions to increase rates of survival. Select species and adjust
<     timing of establishment to minimize potential effects of known residual herbicides,
<     as needed.
<   - Evaluate the site to determine if mulching, supplemental water, or other cultural
<     treatments (e.g., tree protection devices, shade cards, brush mats, etc.) are
<     needed to ensure adequate survival and establishment, then utilize the appropriate
<     supporting conservation practice. Minimize the need for supplemental water and/or
<     nutrients by choosing site-adapted plant materials, planting methods, and planting
<     seasons.
<   - Protect tree and shrub plantings, seeded areas, and naturally regenerated areas
<     from unacceptable adverse impacts from insects, disease, wildlife, livestock,
<     and fire. Apply supporting practices and treatments as necessary to protect establishing
<     trees and shrubs.
<   - Use tree and shrub planting to supplement natural forest regeneration in locations
<     where additional species or stem densities are desired to meet management objectives.
<     Do not plant trees and shrubs under an overstory scheduled for harvest before
<     seedlings have become established.

<   - Utilize plant materials that have been selected and tested in the NRCS Plant Materials Program or in similar tree and shrub improvement programs when specific performance elements
<     are necessary. Plant materials used for planting treatments can include bare-root stock, containerized
<     stock, seed, stem or root cuttings, or layered bows. Consider the potential impacts
<     of extreme weather events (e.g., drought, flooding, wind, late spring frosts)
<     when selecting plant species and sites for planting. Select trees and shrubs adapted
<     to the site’s natural disturbance regime. If planting in existing forestland,
<     select tree species based on the existing forest’s species traits, successional
<     status, structure, and composition.
<   - Use diverse tree and shrub species combinations which best meet the needs of target
<     wildlife and pollinator species. Enhance wildlife habitat structure in existing
<     forest stands by establishing additional trees and shrubs in the understory. Select
<     tree and shrub species that produce hard or soft mast utilized by targeted wildlife
<     species.

<   Reducing Energy Use:
<   - When trees and shrubs are planted to reduce summer energy use in buildings, consider
<     prioritizing their placement based on the greatest daily solar heat gain (typically the west side).
<     Trees or shrubs planted within 30 to 50 feet of a building generally provide effective
<     shade to windows and walls, depending on tree height potential. Evaluate tree
<     and shrub crown and root spread characteristics before establishing near structures.
<     Deciduous tree or shrub species planted adjacent to the south side of buildings
<     in cool climates can provide shade in the summer yet allow sun to reach the building
<     in winter.
