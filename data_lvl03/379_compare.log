>   - Select species with traits that facilitate increased nutrient cycling and boost
>     organic matter, such as vigorously re-sprouting species for coppicing, species
>     with nitrogen fixation capability, or those that shed large quantities of biomass.
>     Establish management systems that provide frequent biomass inputs to the forest
>     floor, such as a coppice rotation or regular pruning.
>   - Incorporate unused residues from pruning, coppicing, or harvesting back into the
>     soil by mulching or processing into biochar before reapplication to the greatest
>     extent feasible. Refer to CPS 384 for treatment of woody residues.
>   for Incresing Carbon Storage in Biomass and Soils:
>   - Where practical adjust plant spacing and speciesselection to increase above and
>     belowground productivity for increased carbon capture and storage. Select tree species with
>     high carbon storage potential.
>   - Manage without tillage, where possible, to reduce impacts on soil organic matter.
>     Limit the useof petroleum-based herbicides and fertilizers.
