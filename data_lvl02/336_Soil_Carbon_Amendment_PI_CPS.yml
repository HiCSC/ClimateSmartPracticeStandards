conditions: This practice applies to areas of Crop, Pasture, Range, Forest, Associated Agriculture Lands, Developed Land, and Farmstead where organic carbon amendment applications will improve soil conditions.
criteia:
  Applicable to All Purposes:
  - Plan, design, and implement carbon amendment applications in compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
    The owner or operator is responsible for securing all required permits or approvals and for applying in amendment in accordance with such laws and regulations.
  - Evaluate site using appropriate planning criteria, assessment tools, or evaluation activities for the intended land use to determine where soil carbon amendments will achieve the intended purpose(s).
  - Test the soil prior to amendment application.
    Use laboratories meeting current requirements and performance standards of the North American Proficiency Testing Program under the auspices of the Soil Science Society of America or use an alternative State-approved certification program that considers laboratory performance and proficiency to ensure accuracy of soil test results.
  - Follow Land Grant University (LGU) or industry guidance to collect, prepare, store and ship soil samples.
    Ensure sampling protocol and laboratory soil test methods are the same as those required by the State-adapted NRCS Conservation Practice Standard (CPS) Nutrient Management (Code 590).
  - - 'At a minimum, measure the following soil properties:'
    - '  • Soil pH.'
    - '  • Soil texture.'
    - '  • Soil organic matter or soil organic carbon.'
    - '  • Extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulfur, and magnesium.'
    - '  • Cation exchange capacity.'
  - - 'Test for any of the following properties when applicable to local conditions or conservation objectives:'
    - '  • Aluminum, sodium, and soluble salts (electrical conductivity).'
    - '  • Bulk density.'
    - '  • Aggregate stability.'
    - '  • Available water capacity.'
    - '  • Iron, manganese, copper, zinc.'
  for All Amendments:
  - Prior to application, document the physical and chemical analysis (i.e., composition and properties) of amendment per amendment category near the time of application.
    Current amendment analysis documentation shall be provided by the party who produces the amendment.
  - Apply carbon amendments with minimal disturbance at a rate and time that will achieve the intended purpose.
  - Evaluate the landscape, soil properties, amendment composition, plant nutrient needs, and application rate to determine if NRCS CPS Nutrient Management (Code 590) is needed to address nutrient-related resource concerns.
  - Do not apply high-salt materials (>8 mmhos/cm) where salinity is a concern.
  - - 'Do not apply amendments:'
    - '  • Produced from crop residues that could otherwise provide soil protection and improve soil health (e.g., stover or straw) or from woody residue that is necessary to sustain forest health and support wildlife habitat as referenced in NRCS CPS Forest Stand Improvement (Code 666).'
    - '  • During high wind events.'
    - '  • Where soil, site, climate, or condition pose a significant risk of loss due to slope, runoff potential, rainfall or irrigation intensity, or other factors.'
    - '  • To areas where negative impacts on air or water resources or nutrient cycling may occur.'
    - '  • That may contain undesirable plant propagules or seeds.'
    - '  • Where changes to the plant community could be undesirable or unknown (e.g., changing a native or an established desired community etc.).'
    - '  • When nutrients in the amendment will not be directly used (e.g., nutrient-rich amendment applications to fallow land or fields without existing or planned vegetative cover).'
    - '  • Such as raw manure or biosolids.
           When applying soil amendments such as raw manure and biosolids refer to NRCS Conservation Practice Standard Nutrient Management (Code 590).'
  - For operations certified under USDA’s National Organic Program (NOP), apply and manage amendments according to program regulations, including but not limited to compost temperature and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) requirements under 7 CFR §205.203.
    Operators should consult their certifying agent to ensure compliance with NOP standards (or other certification programs or marketing agreements) prior to application.
  - Evaluate the cumulative impacts of critical amendment components such as nutrients, nutrient interactions, toxicants, or contaminants when planning repeat applications.
    Include a monitoring plan as appropriate based on risk.
  - When feedstocks have higher risk of synthetic organic or heavy metal contaminants, evaluate amendment as appropriate for contaminant and amendment type (e.g., processed municipal waste feedstocks that may contain pesticide residues, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl’s (PCBs), and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), etc.).
  - Report values for all parameters listed in table 1. 
    Identify any parameter that may limit the application of amendments.
    Do not apply amendments if the maximum allowable levels listed are exceeded.

  - Apply biochar under weather conditions using application methods that reduce risk of off-site movement and follow worker safety precautions, including use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
  Other carbon amendments:
  - Use regionally-appropriate carbon-based materials to fulfill the purpose(s).
    Other carbon amendments may include but are not limited to waste plant materials that would otherwise not provide a conservation benefit (e.g., harvested invasive aquatic species), wood chips, pulverized paper, bagasse, or distillation residue.
  - Follow State specific criteria for regionally appropriate carbon-based materials.
considerations:
  General Considerations:
  - Add mature, stable compost (i.e., based on maturity index, respirometry, or documented time and temperature of composting process) that will increase soil biological activity and diversity to enhance root health and promote resistance to pathogenic organisms.
  - Apply low H:Corg biochar (<0.7) to maximize soil carbon sequestration.
  - Inoculate biochar with compost, compost tea, or manure to balance nutrients and nutrient interactions, stabilize pH, and improve amendment moisture content to aid application.
    Determine if NRCS CPS Nutrient Management (Code 590) is needed to address nutrient-related resource concerns.
  - - Adjust nutrient management and pest management plans as needed for the specific amendment type and purpose.
    - '     • Compost or other amendments with C:N greater than 30:1 can immobilize nutrients, especially nitrogen, and may necessitate supplemental nitrogen applications for plant growth.'
    - '     • The targeted C:N ratio for compost or other amendments is 20:1. C:N ratios below 15:1 are likely to mineralize N and should be used at a time when plant N demand will prevent N loss.'
    - '     • Biochar with high adsorptive capacity can reduce the effectiveness of some pesticides.'
  - Time operations to minimize potential soil compaction and evaluate traffic routes to prevent erosion.
    Consider coordinating amendment applications with other operations to minimize traffic (e.g., seed and apply compost at the same time).
    Disturbed areas should be appropriately treated to minimize potential erosion.
  - Consider potential contamination pathways to crops typically consumed raw, water distribution systems, etc. when applying amendments that may contain pathogens (e.g., biological soil amendments of animal origin including composted manure, composted carcasses; reference the Food and Drug Administration’s Food Safety Modernization Act at www.fda.gov/FSMA).
  - Reduce risk of off-site movement or spontaneous ignition by properly storing and handling amendments.
    When staging materials for application, locate piles where they will not increase risk of material or leachate loss to sensitive areas.
  Considerations to Maintain or Improve Soil Organic Matter and Sequester Carbon:
  - When applying soil carbon amendment with diesel-powered equipment and vehicles, consider using Tier 3 or Tier 4 emissions certified diesel engines to minimize nitrous oxides and particulate matter emissions from diesel exhaust and to maximize climate benefits.
  - Consider life cycle analysis of the amendment that evaluates the feedstock source, processing and transportation impacts on carbon and greenhouse gas accounting.
  - Consider using COMET-Farm or COMET-Planner to estimate changes in carbon and greenhouse gas emissions of planned practices.
  - - 'On cropland, soil organic carbon is related to the volume of soil disturbed, intensity of the disturbance, soil moisture content, and soil temperature at the time the disturbance occurs. 
  Make this practice most effective at increasing soil organic carbon stocks, improving soil health and reducing carbon loss:'
    - '  • Perform any deep soil disturbance, such as ripping, subsoiling, or fertilizer injection, so the vertical slot created by the implements is closed at the surface.'
    - '  • Perform soil disturbance at a time when exposed soil carbon is less likely to be oxidized and lost as CO2 (e.g., when soil temperatures are below 50º F or when soil is not excessively wet or excessively dry).'
plans_specifications:
- - 'In the soil carbon amendment plan, include:'
  - '  • Purpose of practice.'
  - '  • Assessment of soil health resource concerns using State-approved tools for the appropriate land use.'
  - '  • Results of laboratory soil health tests that include, at a minimum soil organic matter or soil organic carbon and include other soil health properties based on the purpose(s) and resource concern(s) to be addressed.'
  - '  • Map and site description of conservation management units receiving amendments (e.g., crop rotation, native vegetation, etc.).'
  - '  • Aerial photos that include locations of sensitive areas and setbacks, as applicable.'
  - '  • Soil survey map of the site.'
  - '  • Soil information including but not limited to soil type, surface texture, slope, runoff class, drainage class, flooding and ponding frequency and duration, or soil interpretations designed for general land use planning which provide dynamic soil property information and/or soil health response to carbon amendments (i.e., Dynamic Soil Properties Response to Biochar found in Web Soil Survey under Suitabilities and Limitations tab).'
  - '  • Plant information including but not limited to existing, invasive, noxious, rare, or wetland plant species as noted in the PLANTS database, as applicable.'
  - '  • Complete amendment analysis (See General Criteria for each amendment type).'
  - '  • Application rate, method, timing, and when applicable, method of incorporation.'
  - '  • Monitoring plan for amendment effectiveness for the planned purpose(s) using appropriate monitoring activities. 
    Include a soil organic matter or soil organic carbon test to determine the effectiveness of the application for improving soil health and soil organic carbon 1 to 3 years after application.
    Soil testing at least 3 years or more after application may monitor longer-term impacts.'
operations_maintanance:
- Calibrate application equipment to ensure accurate distribution of material at planned rates.
- Inspect and evaluate surface applied amendments after the first heavy precipitation event to ensure the material is stable and does not impact non-target areas.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the amendment (application, amount of cover provided, durability, etc.) and adjust future management or type of amendment to better meet the intended purpose(s).
