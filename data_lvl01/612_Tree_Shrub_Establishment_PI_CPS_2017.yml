practice_name: TREE/SHRUB ESTABLISHMENT
practice_code: '612'
unit: (ac)
version: PI - January 2017
definition: Establishing woody plants by planting seedlings or cuttings, by direct
  seeding, and/or through natural regeneration.
purpose:
- Establish woody plants to—
- '           • Maintain or improve desirable plant diversity, productivity, and health
  by establishing woody plants'
- '           • Create or improve habitat for desired wildlife species compatible
  with ecological characteristics of the site'
- '           • Control erosion'
- '           • Improve water quality. Reduce excess nutrients and other pollutants
  in runoff and groundwater'
- '           • Sequester and store carbon'
- '           • Restore or maintain native plant communities'
- '           • Develop renewable energy systems'
- '           • Conserve energy'
- '           • Provide for beneficial organisms and pollinators'
conditions: Tree/shrub establishment can be applied on any site capable of growing
  woody plants.
criteia:
  Applicable to All Purposes:
  - Select one or more species that are suited to soil and site conditions, and appropriate
    for the planned
  - purpose(s). Use the PIA Vegetative Specification to generate initial recommendations
    for planting lists.
  - Determine desired stocking levels for trees and/or shrubs based on ecological
    characteristics of the site and species, and landowner objectives. Plant or seed
    at densities/rates that reflect anticipated seedling mortality, to achieve desired
    stocking levels in the established stand.
  - Use NRCS Conservation Practice Standard (CPS) Tree/Shrub Site Preparation (Code
    490) as the initial practice to prepare sites for planting or seeding, if conditions
    are not suitable for establishing the desired plants.
  - Use tree/shrub planting to accomplish or supplement forest stand regeneration
    in locations where natural regeneration of desired species is not possible, or
    will not meet objectives.
  - ''
  - Select only viable, high-quality, and adapted plant materials. Select planting
    stock that conforms to established seed transfer protocols within the State, and
    complies with minimum standards accepted by the American National Standards Institute
    (ANSI). Do not plant any species on the Federal or State invasive species or noxious
    weed lists.
  - Choose appropriate planting dates and handling methods to increase rates of survival.
    Select planting techniques and timing appropriate for soil and site conditions.
  - Alter species selection and/or timing of planting/seeding to minimize potential
    effects of residual chemical carryover, as needed.
  - Evaluate the site to determine if mulching, supplemental water or other cultural
    treatments (e.g., tree protection devices, shade cards, fertilizer, brush mats,
    etc.) are needed to assure adequate survival and establishment. Minimize the need
    for supplemental water and/or nutrients by choosing site-adapted plant materials,
    planting methods, and planting seasons. Where supplemental moisture is needed
    to achieve tree/shrub establishment use NRCS CPS Irrigation System, Microirrigation
    (Code 441).
  - Protect tree and shrub plantings, seeded areas, and naturally regenerated areas,
    from unacceptable adverse impacts of pests, wildlife, livestock, and/or fire.
    Protect from pests, as necessary, by applying integrated pest management techniques
    for pest prevention, avoidance, monitoring, and suppression.
  - Removal of products (e.g., trees, biomass, medicinal herbs, nuts, fruits, etc.)
    is allowed, provided that conservation purpose(s) are not compromised by the loss
    of vegetation or by harvesting disturbance.
  to Create or Improve Habitat for Desired Wildlife Species:
  - Specify site-appropriate target wildlife species, identify and establish plant
    species that will provide forage,
  - browse, seed, cover, and/or nesting habitat for the desired wildlife species.
    High plant species diversity is desirable. Refer to species selection and establishment
    criteria in NRCS CPS Upland Wildlife Habitat Management (Code 645).
  for Reducing Nutrients and Pollutants:
  - When plantings are used to remove excess nutrients from runoff or groundwater,
    select species that have
  - fast-growth characteristics, extensive root systems, and a high-nutrient uptake
    capacity. Trees and shrubs used to reduce pollutants must be tolerant of the types
    of pollutants contained in effluent or soils at the site.
  for Restoring or Maintaining Native Plant Communities:
  - Species selected for planting, or those favored in natural regeneration, will
    be native to the site and will
  - create a successional state that progresses toward the identified target plant
    community.
  for Sequestering and Storing Carbon:
  - For shorter term, rapid carbon sequestration, select species that have high-growth
    rates, recognizing that
  - they are typically short-lived. For longer term storage of carbon, select plants
    with a long life span, the ability to reach a large size, high-wood density, and
    potential for use in long-lived products. Establish and maintain a fully stocked
    stand.
  for Developing Renewable Energy Systems:
  - Select plants that can provide adequate types and amounts of plant biomass to
    supply identified
  - bioenergy needs.
  - Manage the intensity and frequency of energy biomass removals to prevent long-term
    negative impacts to the site. Harvest biomass for energy in a manner that will
    not compromise other intended purpose(s) and functions of the site.
  to Conserve Energy:
  - Increase energy efficiency by planting trees to provide shade for buildings. Select
    plants with a potential
  - height growth that will be taller than the structure or facility being protected.
  - Use proper plant densities to optimize the shade produced.
  - Design tree and shrub plantings to avoid damage to structures, and to allow adequate
    space for maintenance access to walls and windows. Plant at a distance that is
    greater than mature crown spread, and select species that develop deep root systems.
  - To protect structures from heat loss due to wind, use NRCS CPS Windbreak Establishment
    (Code 380).
  for Habitat for Beneficial Organisms:
  - Plant trees and shrubs that provide habitat and food sources for beneficial organisms,
    such as pollinators,
  - predatory and parasitic insects, spiders, insectivorous birds and bats, raptors,
    and terrestrial rodent predators. Select plant species that meet dietary, nesting,
    and cover requirements for the intended beneficial organisms during the critical
    period for control of target pests and, if possible, for the entire year. Protect
    beneficial organisms from harmful pesticides.
considerations:
  Consider utilizing plant materials that have been selected and tested in the Plant Materials Program or in:
  - similar tree/shrub improvement programs.
  - Consider using diverse tree and shrub species combinations which best meet the
    needs of desired wildlife and pollinator species.
  - When selecting plant materials, consider whether the species, variety, or cultivar
    possesses aggressive traits, and whether it poses a potential threat to the existing
    or desired plant community.
  - Consider the potential impacts of extreme weather events (e.g., drought, flooding,
    wind) when selecting plant species and sites for planting.
  - When using trees and shrubs for carbon sequestration and storage, consider using
    modeling tools to predict carbon sequestration rates and amounts of stored carbon.
  - Tree/shrub arrangement and spacing should allow for and anticipate the need for
    future access lanes for purposes of stand management and fire control.
  - Consider establishing species with growth rates and at densities that make them
    competitive with weeds and undesirable plants.
  - Consider using species that provide subsistence and cultural values, (e.g., as
    used by Tribes).
  Organic Systems During Vegetation Establishment:
  - Natural or fully biodegradable mulches such as wood chips, cardboard or hay, can
    be used to support
  - tree/shrub establishment by controlling competing vegetation. Certified weed-free
    mulches are preferred. Use NRCS CPS Mulching (Code 484).
  - Pests may be managed through augmentation or introduction of predators or parasites
    and development of habitat for natural enemies of pests; non-synthetic controls
    such as lures, traps, and repellents may be used.
  - 'Invasive plant species may be controlled through: mulching; mowing; livestock
    grazing with protection for plantings; hand weeding and mechanical cultivation.'
plans_specifications:
- Prepare plans and specifications that describe requirements for applying the practice
  to achieve its intended purpose, and obtain any required permits.
- 'Use the Pacific Islands Area Vegetative Specification to record the implementation
  requirements. At a minimum, provide:'
- '  • Objective(s) for establishment.'
- '  • Sketches, drawings, and detail drawings.'
- '  • Map showing the location of plantings and/or natural regeneration areas.'
- '  • Soils map, and description of soils and Ecological Sites (if available).'
- '  • Establishment method by species or vegetation type.'
- '  • Number of trees/shrubs per acre to be planted, by species.'
- '  • Timing of planting and/or natural regeneration relative to considerations for
  seasonal factors, plant physiology, disease, insects, and wildlife impacts.'
- '  • Mitigation measures, if needed, to reduce wildfire hazard or the potential
  for disease and insect pests.'
operations_maintanance:
- 'Prepare an operation and maintenance plan for this site. As a minimum, include
  the following activities:'
- '  • Do not conduct maintenance practices and activities during the primary reproductive
  period of wildlife. Exceptions can be considered to maintain the health of the vegetative
  community if such exceptions do not conflict with agency requirements.'
- '  • Mow the area periodically if practical and needed to maintain the health of
  the plant community.'
- '  • Control access by vehicles and/or equipment during or after tree/shrub establishment
  to protect new plants and minimize erosion, compaction and other site impacts.'
- '  • Inspect the site at an appropriate time following planting, seeding, and/or
  natural regeneration to determine whether the survival rate for tree and shrubs
  meets practice and client objectives. Replant or provide supplemental planting when
  survival is not adequate.'
- '  • Inspect the trees and shrubs periodically, and protect them from adverse impacts
  of insects, diseases, competing vegetation, fire, livestock, wildlife, non-functioning
  tree shelters and/or weed barriers, etc.'
- '  • If needed, control competing vegetation until the desired trees/shrubs are
  established. Control plant species on the Federal or State invasive species and
  noxious weed lists.'
- '  • If needed, apply nutrients to maintain vigor of desirable trees/shrubs.'
