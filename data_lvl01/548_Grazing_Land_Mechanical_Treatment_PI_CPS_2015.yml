practice_name: GRAZING LAND MECHANICAL TREATMENT
practice_code: '548'
unit: (ac)
version: PI - February 2015
definition: Modifying physical soil and/or plant conditions with mechanical tools
  by treatments such as pitting, contour furrowing, and chiseling, ripping or subsoiling.
purpose:
- This practice is used to accomplish one or more of the following purposes–
- '           • Fracture compacted soil layers and improve soil permeability'
- '           • Reduction in water runoff and increased infiltration'
- '           • Break up root-bound conditions and thatch to increase plant vigor'
- '           • Renovation and stimulation of plant community for greater productivity
  and yield'
conditions: This standard may be applied on pastureland, rangeland, grazed forest,
  and native pastures where the slopes are less than 30 percent.
criteia:
- Mechanical treatments such as contour furrowing, pitting, chiseling, ripping, or
  subsoiling shall be
- designed and applied in a manner to accomplish the desired objectives and address
  the natural resource concerns. These treatments shall be limited to soils and slopes
  where surface disturbances will not result in unacceptable levels of soil erosion
  and/or sedimentation. Prescribed grazing (528) will follow any grazing land mechanical
  treatment application.
- Areas to be treated shall be relatively free of undesirable or noxious plants that
  are likely to increase because of surface disturbance.
- If natural plant community is desired, desirable plant species shall be of sufficient
  quantity and have a distribution pattern that allows the plants to take advantage
  of the improved moisture and to spread into disturbed areas.
- Adequate rest from grazing shall be applied to ensure desired plant responses from
  this treatment.
- All treatments should be planned on the contour when conditions warrant.
- Assure soil is not too wet prior to treatment.
- All work performed under this standard shall comply with State, federal, and local
  laws and regulations.
considerations:
- Conservation practice standards Range Planting (550), Forage and Biomass Planting
  (512), Prescribed Grazing (528), Herbaceous Weed Control (315), and Nutrient Management
  (590) may be used in conjunction with Grazing Land Mechanical Treatment.
- Increase in noxious or invasive plants may occur following treatment.
- Increased surface roughness may make the treated area undesirable for some uses.
- Investigate for compacted layers with a probe or other appropriate tool prior to
  treatment.
- Investigate for tile drainage systems, pipelines and other buried structures prior
  to work.
- Consider animal’s ability to navigate terrain following treatment.
- Consider cultural resources when planning this practice. If the selected mechanical
  treatment will exceed the depth of prior ground disturbance, this activity could
  affect buried cultural resources.
plans_specifications: Specifications for installation of Grazing Land Mechanical Treatment
  shall be prepared for each site or planning unit according to the criteria. Specifications
  shall be recorded using the Pacific Islands Area Grazing Land Mechanical Treatment
  (548) jobsheet.
operations_maintanance:
- Implementation of a prescribed grazing plan according to the 528 standard is essential
  for the long-term operation of this practice. Heavy equipment use that will compact
  the soil in treated areas shall be deferred until autogenic repair processes have
  been restored. If the desired effects of grazing land mechanical treatment are lost
  over time, the practice may need to be repeated.
- Record practice operation and maintenance using the Pacific Islands Area Grazing
  Land Mechanical Treatment (548) jobsheet.
