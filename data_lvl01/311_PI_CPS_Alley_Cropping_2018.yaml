practice_name: ALLEY CROPPING
version: PI - September 2018
definition: Trees or shrubs are planted in sets of single or multiple rows with agronomic,
  horticultural crops or forages produced in the alleys between the sets of woody
  plants that produce additional products.
purpose:
- This practice is used to accomplish one or more of the following purposes–
- Enhance microclimatic conditions to improve crop or forage quality and quantity
- Reduce surface water runoff and erosion
- Improve soil health by increasing utilization and cycling of nutrients
- Alter subsurface water quantity or water table depths
- Enhance wildlife and beneficial insect habitat
- Increase crop diversity
- Decrease offsite movement of nutrients or chemicals
- Increase carbon storage in plant biomass and soils
- Develop renewable energy systems
- Improve air quality
applicable_conditions: On all cropland and hayland where trees, shrubs, crops, and
  forages can be grown in combination.
criteria:
  general:
  - General Criteria Applicable to All Purposes
  - Combinations of crops or forages and woody plants must be compatible and complementary.
  - Plants must be adapted to the climatic region and the soil resource.
  - Crop or forage sequence and woody species selection must be determined using an
    acceptable nutrient balance procedure. Plants selected will maximize the utilization
    and cycling of soil nutrients and plant residues to maintain soil organic matter
    content.
  - Moisture conservation or supplemental watering must be provided for plant establishment
    and growth where natural precipitation is too low for the selected species.
  - Select pest resistant plant varieties.
  - Avoid selecting tree or shrub species which provide habitat to pests of the accompanying
    crop or forage.
  - Select crop, forage, tree and/or shrub varieties based on their tolerance to agriculture
    chemicals that will be used at the site.
  - The distance between the sets of trees or shrubs will be determined by—
  - •   Tree or shrub management objectives.
  - •   Light, nutrient and water requirements and growth period of the crops or forages
    in the alleys.
  - •   Erosion control needs.
  - •   Machinery widths and turning areas.
  - Soil erosion will be controlled by vegetative or other means until the alley cropping
    design is fully functional.
  - Refer to criteria in Conservation Practice Standard (CPS) Tree/Shrub Establishment
    (Code 612) for further guidance on planting trees and shrubs.
  additional:
  - - Additional Criteria Additional Criteria to Reduce Surface Water Runoff and Erosion
    - Tree or shrub rows will be oriented on or near the contour to reduce water erosion.
    - To reduce surface water runoff and erosion, herbaceous ground cover will be
      established in conjunction with the tree or shrub rows.
    - To reduce wind erosion, tree or shrub rows will be oriented as close as possible
      perpendicular to erosive winds.
    - Selected species of trees and shrubs will be relatively deep rooted to encourage
      infiltration.
  - - Additional Criteria to Increase Carbon Storage
    - Select tree and shrubs species with rapid growth rates and high wood density.
    - Plant/manage the appropriate density for the site that will maximize above-
      and below-ground biomass production.
    - Minimize soil disturbance through use of no-till methods.
  - - Additional Criteria to Develop Renewable Energy Systems
    - Select plants that can provide adequate kinds and amounts of plant biomass to
      supply identified bioenergy needs.
    - Intensity and frequency of energy biomass removals will be managed to prevent
      long-term negative impacts on the system.
    - The harvesting of energy biomass must be accomplished in a manner that will
      not compromise the other intended purpose(s) and functions.
  - - Additional Criteria to Improve Air Quality
    - Residue from the alley-crop must be left on the surface.
    - Select and maintain tree/shrub species with foliar and structural characteristics
      that optimize interception, adsorption and absorption of particulates.
    - Tree or shrub rows will be oriented as close to perpendicular as possible to
      prevailing wind direction during the critical air period.
considerations:
- Plant tree/shrub/vine sets in an east-west orientation to maximize sunlight in alleys
  when other factors do not override this consideration.
- Species diversity including use of native species should be considered to avoid
  loss of function due to species-specific pests or to enhance wildlife needs.
- Consider the invasive potential when selecting plant species.
- High value trees or shrubs should be selected to maximize economic returns.
- Coppice ability of selected species of trees and shrubs should be considered when
  they are to be pruned or harvested periodically for use as fodder or mulch – nitrogen
  fixing species can be particularly beneficial.
- Select crops, forages and woody plants for water requirements not to exceed available
  soil water.
- Select crops, forages and woody plants with compatible rooting depths to better
  utilize available soil moisture and nutrients.
- Consider modifying microclimatic conditions and habitat to enhance biological pest
  management.
plans_and_specifications: Plans and specifications for applying this practice must
  be prepared for each site and recorded using the Pacific Islands Alley Cropping
  (Code 311) Implementation Requirements template as well as approved specification
  sheets, job sheets, technical notes and narrative statements in the conservation
  plan, or other acceptable documentation as applicable.
operations_and_maintanance:
- The trees, shrubs, crops and forages will be inspected periodically and protected
  from adverse impacts including insects, diseases or competing vegetation. The trees
  or shrubs will also be protected from fire and damage from livestock or wildlife.
- All other specified maintenance measures and techniques of tree/shrub establishment
  will continue until plant survival and establishment are assured. This includes
  replacement of dead and dying trees or shrubs, pruning of dead or damaged branches
  for safety reasons, periodic pruning of selected branches for control of product
  quality, and control of undesirable competing vegetation.
- Any removals of tree or shrub products, use of agricultural chemicals, and maintenance
  operations must be consistent with the intended purpose of the practice. Avoid damaging
  the site and soil and comply with applicable Federal, State and local regulations
  pertaining to onsite and offsite effects.
