practice_name: BRUSH MANAGEMENT
practice_code: '314'
unit: (ac)
version: PI - September 2018
definition: The management or removal of woody (nonherbaceous or succulent) plants
  including those that are invasive and noxious.
purpose:
- This practice is used to accomplish one or more of the following purposes–
- '           • Create the desired plant community consistent with the ecological
  site or a desired state within the site description'
- '           • Restore or release desired vegetative cover to protect soils, control
  erosion, reduce sediment, improve water quality, or enhance hydrology'
- '           • Maintain, modify, or enhance fish and wildlife habitat'
- '           • Improve forage accessibility, quality, and quantity for livestock
  and wildlife'
- '           • Manage fuel loads to achieve desired conditions'
- '           • Pervasive plant species are controlled to a desired level of treatment
  that will ultimately contribute to creation or maintenance of an ecological site
  description “steady state” addressing the need for forage, wildlife habitat, and/or
  water quality'
conditions:
- On all lands except active cropland where the removal, reduction, or manipulation
  of woody (nonherbaceous or succulent) plants is desired.
- This practice does not apply to removal of woody vegetation to facilitate a land-use
  change (use CPS Land Clearing (Code 460)).
criteia:
  Applicable to All Purposes:
  - Brush management will be designed to achieve the desired plant community based
    on species
  - composition, structure, density, and canopy (or foliar) cover or height.
  - Brush management will achieve the desired control of the target woody species
    and protection of desired species. This will be accomplished by mechanical, chemical,
    or biological methods, either alone or in combination
  - When the intent is to manage trees for silvicultural purposes, use CPS Forest
    Stand Improvement (Code 666).
  - ''
  - ''
  - It is the responsibility of the planner and the client to identify a proven strategy
    for use on targeted species under this practice. Strategies must provide for adequate
    control to address the resource concern for the lifespan of the practice (10 years).
    Consult with local extension specialists, NRCS technical specialists, invasive
    species councils, watershed partnerships, published references or websites and/or
    other professionals including other conservation planners and producers that have
    experience managing the targeted species.
  - NRCS will not develop biological or chemical treatment recommendations except
    for biological control utilizing grazing animals. In such cases, CPS Prescribed
    Grazing (Code 528) is used to ensure desired results are achieved and maintained.
    NRCS may provide clients with acceptable biological and/or chemical control references.
  - In cases where there is insufficient understory vegetation to provide a seed source
    to result in the desired plant community, use CPS Range Planting (Code 550) or
    CPS Forage and Biomass Planting (Code 512) to ensure the desired results are achieved
    and maintained.
  - Follow-up treatments may be necessary to achieve objectives.
  for Creating the Desired Plant Community Consistent with the Ecological Site:
  - Use applicable ecological site description (ESD) state and transition models to
    develop specifications that
  - are ecologically sound and defensible. Treatments must be congruent with dynamics
    of the ecological site(s) and keyed to state and plant community phases that have
    the potential and capability to support the desired plant community. If an ESD
    is not available, base specifications on the best approximation of the desired
    plant community composition, structure, and function to support resilience.
  - Additional treatments are planned and will be applied to achieve effective control
    of pervasive plant species through reapplication.
  for Restoring or Releasing Desired Vegetative Cover to Protect Soils, Con-:
  - trolErosion, Reduce Sediment, Improve Water Quality or Enhance Hydrology
  - Choose a method of control that results in the least amount of soil disturbance
    if soil erosion potential is high and revegetation is slow or uncertain leaving
    the site vulnerable to long-term exposure to soil loss.
  - In conjunction with other conservation practices, the number, sequence, and timing
    of soil-disturbing operations must be managed to maintain soil loss within acceptable
    levels using approved erosion prediction technology. An appropriate revegetation
    practice will follow mechanical treatments that result in large bare areas to
    ensure a desirable plant community post-treatment.
  to Maintain, Modify or Enhance Fish and Wildlife Habitat:
  - Brush management will be planned and applied in a manner to meet the habitat requirements
    for wildlife
  - species of concern as determined by an approved habitat evaluation procedure.
  - Conduct treatments during periods of the year that accommodate reproduction and
    other life-cycle requirements of target wildlife and pollinator species, and in
    accordance with specifications developed for CPS Wetland Wildlife Habitat Management
    (Code 644) and CPS Upland Wildlife Habitat Management (Code 645).
  to Improve Forage Accessibility, Quality and Quantity for Livestock andWildlife:
  - Timing and sequence of brush management must be planned in coordination with specifications
  - developed for CPS Prescribed Grazing (Code 528). An appropriate revegetation practice
    will follow mechanical treatments that result in large bare areas to ensure a
    desirable plant community post- treatment.
  for Control of Pervasive Plant Species to a Desired Level of Treatment ThatWill:
  - Ultimately Contribute to Creation or Maintenance of an Ecological Site Description
    “SteadyState”
  - Addressing the Need for Forage, Wildlife Habitat, and/or Water Quality. Additional
    treatments are planned and will be applied to achieve effective control of pervasive
    plant species through reapplication. Treatments must either be proven or be reasonably
    expected to lead to successful reduction and management with consultation with
    the SRMS or UH Extension Specialist.
  to Manage Fuel Loads to Achieve Desired Conditions:
  - Control undesirable woody plants in a manner that creates the desired plant community,
    including the
  - desired fuel load, to reduce the risk of wildfire, and facilitate the future application
    of prescribed fire.
considerations:
- Consider effects to Water Quality for chemical and mechanical treatments. Evaluate
  chemical usage with WIN-PST or other agency-approved evaluation tool. Plan mechanical
  treatments, brush manipulations and revegetation activities to minimize risk of
  sediment moving into surface water.
- Consider using CPS Integrated Pest Management (Code 595) in support of brush management.
- Consider the appropriate time period for treatment. Some brush management activities
  can be effective when applied within a single year; others may require multiple
  years of treatment(s) to achieve desired objectives.
- Consider impacts and consequences to obligate species (species dependent on the
  target woody species) when significant changes are planned to existing and adjacent
  plant communities.
- Consider impacts to wildlife food supplies, space, nesting, and cover availability
  when planning the method and amount of brush management.
- State-issued licenses may be required when using chemical pesticide treatments.
- For air quality purposes, consider using chemical methods of brush management that
  minimize chemical drift and excessive chemical usage, and consider mechanical methods
  of brush management that minimize the entrainment of particulate matter.

operations_maintanance:
- Operation Brush management practices must be applied using approved materials and
  procedures. Operations will comply with all local, State, and Federal laws and ordinances.
- Success of the practice shall be determined by evaluating post-treatment regrowth
  of target species after sufficient time has passed to monitor the situation and
  gather reliable data. Length of evaluation periods will depend on the woody species
  being monitored, proximity of propagules (seeds, branches, and roots) to the site,
  transport mode of seeds (wind or animals), and methods and materials used.
- 'The operator will develop a safety plan for individuals exposed to chemicals, including
  telephone numbers and addresses of emergency treatment centers and the telephone
  number for the nearest poison control center. The National Pesticide Information
  Center (NPIC) telephone number in Corvallis, Oregon, may also be given for nonemergency
  information: 1-800-858-7384, Monday to Friday, 6:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time.
  The national Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTRAC) telephone number
  is 1-800-424-9300.'
